1. Using the grammar below, show a parse tree and a leftmost derivation for the following 
statement: 
                            A = B * (C * (A + B))
                                / (assign.)= \
                              ident.       expres.
                               /              \
                              A                *
                                              / \
                                           term factor
                                        factor   |
                                    identifier   |
                                         /    expres.
                                        /        \
                                       B          *
                                                 / \
                                              term factor
                                           factor    |
                                       identifier    |
                                            /     expres.
                                           /         \
                                          C          +
                                                    / \
                                                  term term
                                                  /      \
                                            identifier    \
                                                /          |
                                               A           B

2. 

a. Using Static Scope, what is printed to the screen?  
 
Python Static

u = 42
v = 69
w = 17

def add(z):
    global u, v
    u = v + u + z

def bar(fun):
    global u
    u = w
    fun(v)

def foo(x, w):
    global v
    v = x
    bar(add)

foo(u, 13)
print(f"u: {u}")
    
    - 101

b. Using Dynamic Scope with Deep Binding, what is printed to the screen?  

  output  -  97

  Deep binding uses the current values of variables from the calling context, which gives 
  the correct result, while static binding uses the values from the 
  context where the function was defined, which can lead to outdated or incorrect results.

c. Using Dynamic Scope with Shallow Binding, what is printed to the screen?  
 
Bash Example(Python had problems with shallow Binding):

#!/bin/bash

u=42
v=69
w=17
z=0
fun=0
x=0

add() {
    z=$1
    u=$((v + u + z))
}

bar() {
    fun=$1
    u=$w
    "$fun" "$v"
}

foo() {
    x=$1
    w=$2
    v=$x
    bar add
}

# Call foo function with u and 13
foo "$u" 13
echo "u: $u"

  output  -  97

shallow binding gets the same answer as deep binding, but runs faster
